                            <li><strong>Mitigating Factors:</strong> Factors such as provocation, mental illness, or self-defense can potentially lead to lesser charges, such as culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304, which carries a punishment of up to 10 years of imprisonment.</li>

                                    <p>Individuals who are not born citizens can apply for citizenship through a legal process known as naturalization. This process typically involves fulfilling residency requirements, passing a citizenship test, and taking an oath of allegiance.</p>

                                    <h4>What to Do:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Report Suspicious Activities:</strong> If you suspect someone is being trafficked, report it to local authorities or anti-trafficking helplines.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Stay Vigilant:</strong> Be cautious of job offers that seem too good to be true, especially those that require relocation without sufficient details.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Support Victims:</strong> Provide assistance, shelter, or guidance for victims, and help them connect with rehabilitation services.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <h4>What Not to Do:</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Avoid Unverified Job Offers:</strong> Do not engage with recruiters or employers offering overseas or distant job placements without verifying their legitimacy.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Do Not Neglect Reporting:</strong> It is important to report any signs of human trafficking to the authorities rather than ignoring it.</li>
                                    </ul>
