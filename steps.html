        <h1>Legal Procedures for Resolving Common Disputes</h1>
        <p>Below are the steps you can follow to resolve various legal issues without the help of an advocate.</p>

        <!-- Procedure 1 -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h2>Property Dispute Resolution Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the ownership records of the property in question.</li>
                <li>Try mediation with the other party for an out-of-court settlement.</li>
                <li>File a complaint with the local revenue office if mediation fails.</li>
                <li>Approach the civil court if the issue persists after official complaints.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In Tamil Nadu, if two neighbors dispute the boundary of their properties, they can first try mediation through local panchayat. If unresolved, they can file a complaint with the district revenue officer.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Procedure 2 -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h2>Consumer Dispute Resolution Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact the seller or service provider to request a replacement or refund.</li>
                <li>If unresolved, file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Forum.</li>
                <li>Provide all receipts and proof of purchase to support your case.</li>
                <li>The Consumer Forum will issue a verdict after reviewing the complaint.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A customer in Tamil Nadu purchases a defective product online. After contacting the seller and failing to get a resolution, they file a case with the Tamil Nadu Consumer Court, and the court orders a refund.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Procedure 3 -->
        <div class="procedure-card">
            <h2>Employment Dispute Resolution Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Request a formal meeting with the employer to resolve the issue internally.</li>
                <li>If unsuccessful, file a complaint with the labor office.</li>
                <li>The labor officer will mediate between you and the employer.</li>
                <li>If unresolved, you can take the matter to the Labor Court for legal proceedings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> An employee in Chennai was wrongfully terminated. After approaching the labor office and attending mediation, the issue remains unresolved. The employee files a case in the Labor Court to get compensation.</p>
